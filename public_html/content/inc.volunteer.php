			<p>All these skills and more help to keep Steamrail operating. You can devote as much or as little time as you like to Steamrail, and some tasks can even be done at home. For some railway specific tasks, we provide training and certification.</p>
			<p>Volunteers under 15 years are welcome, but you will need to be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian while volunteering. If you are interested and think you might like to help with a specific project or with the on-going operations, you may like to come down to the depot and inspect the current work in hand and talk to someone about what you can do.</p>
