         <td valign="top"><strong>Important Information</strong><br /><br />
           <strong>Regional Fast Rail -</strong> <span class="arial16nobold">Due to circumstances beyond Steamrail's control, all Steamrail trains operating on the Regional Fast Rail Network (Geelong, Traralgon, Bendigo and Ballarat) are restricted to 80km/h running. This can from time to time have an impact on operating tours along these lines. V/Line Network Access operational needs can from time to time affect the operation of various Steamrail tours.</span><br /><br />
           <strong>Fire Restrictions -</strong> <span class="arial16nobold">Fire Restrictions can be applied across most areas of Victoria by CFA, when fire danger is high. Typically this is over the summer period of November through to April. Restrictions are applied in small areas at a time. View a map of <a href="http://cfaonline.cfa.vic.gov.au/mycfa/Show?pageId=showFrImagePublic" target="_blank">current restrictions</a> across Victorian municipalities.</span><br /><br />

           <strong>Elecrail -</strong> <span class="arial16nobold">Elecrail still has no trips planned at this stage, but talks are progressing with the goal of getting Elecrail operational again. Hopefully it will not be long until Elecrail is back on the rails.</span><br /><br />
           <strong>Cross Posting of Proposed Tour Dates -</strong> <span class="arial16nobold">This is a quick note for the editors of some other website's. Please feel free to cross post the information listed in the main section of this page but please refrain from referring to trips listed solely on the Tour Calendar.
